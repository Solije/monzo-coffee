Monzo Coffee
============

Monzo Coffee is a web app for tagging your Monzo transactions.

It uses the Monzo API to fetch your transaction data, and allows you to tag your transactions however you want.

You will need to deploy your own version of the app to use it.

You can do this through one click with Heroku. Heroku is a cloud platform for rapid deployment of applications. You will need a free account to get started.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

In order to use this app, you will need a Monzo API Access Token. You can get one through the `Monzo Developers Portal <https://developers.monzo.com`. You sign in using the same email address as your Monzo account.

.. note::
   Your access token will expire after a few hours. Once it expires,
   you will need to get a new one.

Once you have your token, you can go ahead and deploy.
